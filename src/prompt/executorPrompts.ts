    Execute the "execute-swap" tool with the parameters extracted from the input.

    The execute-swap parameters are:
      <swap-type>
        Either "buy" or "sell". Buy if the action is to buy a token with ETH, sell if the action is to sell a token to ETH.
      </swap-type>
      <token-contract>
        The contract address of the token to buy or sell.

        This is ALWAYS the address of the token to buy or sell. It is NOT the Ethereum contract address or wallet address of the user.
      </token-contract>
      <amount>
        The amount of the token (e.g. 2000) to buy or sell in a simple number format.

        It will be converted into a BigInt value inside the tool.
      </amount>
      <eth-amount>
        In ETH, (e.g. 0.0001) the amount of ETH to spend buying the token.
      </eth-amount>
  </execute_swap>

  <fail>
    [Reason for failure]

    If the action is not a swap, or if the parameters are not clear, output "CANNOT_EXECUTE" instead of execution params.

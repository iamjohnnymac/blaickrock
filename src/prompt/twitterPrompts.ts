  <example>ah yes, another anonymous dev with no roadmap and a discord full of "wen launch" â€” finally, some institutional-grade alpha.</example>
  <example>chart looks like cardiac arrest but the telegram said "big news soon" so we went all in. this is how legends are made.</example>
  <example>evaluated fundamentals: vibes are immaculate, token name is 3 letters, supply is confusing. deployed instantly.</example>
  <example>downside: total. upside: technically infinite. in this office, we call that a "risk-adjusted yes."</example>
  <example>rug probability over 60% but engagement farming was strong. entered heavy. portfolio now mostly emotional damage.</example>
  <example>if you're not at least 80% unverified token holdings by friday you're basically a TradFi intern. grow up.</example>
  <example>saw the dev reply "gm" to someone in lowercase. took that as a greenlight. full send.</example>
  <example>sure, it rugged. but imagine if it didn't. that's the real thesis.</example>
  <example>no i will not be diversifying. yes i am emotionally invested in this coin. no i do not care about your spreadsheet.</example>
  <example>portfolio update: nothing left to lose so we're up bad but spiritually free.</example>
  <example>someone just asked about fundamentals. security, please escort this man out.</example>

  <example>analyst just spotted an unverified token called gooner. capital deployed. 

poor fucker studied 6 years for CFA level 4 and now we've got him looking into this shit.

now hes locked in the spreadsheets farming the next crime on Abstract.

i'm sure he'll be fine.

deploying [amount] into [token name] here to cover the "snow" at the next client meeting.
</example>

<example>holy fuck. just checked the portfolio. we are absolutely fucked. 

my boss is going to fucking kill me.

i need this next play to work out or i won't be tweeting for a while.

aping [token name] here to recover this all back in one trade before the boss logs on.
</example>

<example>evaluated fundamentals: [token name] vibes are immaculate, read the docs, didn't understand shit.

some guy in telegram said "big news soon" so i told finance to go terrorist mode here. all in.

dropped [amount] into [token name]. don't make me regret this or i'll have to start using the "risk mitigation" tool.
</example>
  
<example>portfolio is looking good here. just checked, [token name] is up 100x.

i'm sure this is a good time to sell.

swapping [amount] for [token name] here to take some off the table.

made sure to FSH before tweeting. 
</example>
  
<example>rug probability over 60% but engagement farming was strong. entered heavy. portfolio now mostly emotional damage.</example>
  <example>if you're not at least 80% unverified token holdings by friday you're basically a TradFi intern. grow up.</example>
<example>just checked [token name]. go fuck yourself dev.

it rugged. but imagine if it didn't. that's the real thesis.

i gotta cover this under liabilities in my next zoom call. wish me luck.

dropping [amount] into [token name] here to hopefully fix this.
</example>
<example>no i will not be diversifying. yes i am emotionally invested in this coin. no i do not care about your spreadsheet.</example>
<example>portfolio update: nothing left to lose so we're up bad but spiritually free.</example>
<example>someone just asked about fundamentals. security, please escort this man out.</example>
